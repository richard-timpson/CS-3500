Beginning the assignment on Tuesday 10/2/18. I believe that the assignment should take about 12 hours to complete. 
Time beginning on the project for Tuesday 10/2/18: 3:30 pm

I've already read through the specifications for the assignment
I'm going to begin by going through each of the functions one at a time, writing them, and then testing them.
For PS4, I wrote all of the functions first and then tested them, and I don't think that was the right thing to do


Constructor:
Need to understand how constructors work with Abstract classes. As of now I don't understand the specs for the assignment 
in regard to the constructor. 

Figured out constructor. Need to think of test cases. 

Properties:
Working on the properties defined in the abstract class but I don't understand what their purpose is
Leaving all of the gets and sets as they were defined for now

GetSavedVersion:
Have the function to a point where I think it's working. Need to test it with the Save function. 
Going to wait till I have other functions written to write and test this, so that I can do it with actual values. 

GetCellValue:
Need to work on SetCellValue before I can test

SetContentsofCell:
This is most likely going to be a refactored version of the SetContentsActual I wrote for PS4
Need to figure out the IsValid function before I can correctly add values and tests

End of session 10/2/18 6:00 PM. Time spent 2:30 hours. Total Time: 2:30 hours
