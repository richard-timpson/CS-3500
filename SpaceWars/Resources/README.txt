CS 3500 - Software Practice
Assignment 7: SpaceWars
Richard Timpson and Johnathan Smith
11/8/18

We are just beginning the assignment. We have decided to outline the folder structurs as follows

Solution:  SpaceWars
	Projects:
		Resources
			Library
			Graphics
		NetworkController
			NetworkControllerClass
		GameController
			GameControllerClass
		GameModel
			World
			Ship
			Projectile
			Start
		View
			Form1
			Program

We decided to put all of the models as classes inside of the same project, to make things simpler. We may need to change this in the future. 
We are hoping to get the project outlined and everythign pipelined together to begin with, and then begin coding the main logic.
