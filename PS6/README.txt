Jon has done most of the work to get the spreadsheet working as it is. So far we have the file menus working good, and the editing of cells working good. 

As of now this our ToDo list

1. Get the save working - Jon
2. Create help menu for TA's - Richard
3. Error messages for exiting without saving - Jon
4. Error message for invalid formula - Richard

For the added options, we are hoping to make it so that you can move cells with the arrow key, edit cells without having to click in contents box
save values on enter, select multiple cells for copy and paste, and possibly a undo/redo button. 

We also need to come up with a list of user tests to make sure functionality is working.
